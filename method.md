## Project Overview
Blueprint is an educational technology (EdTech) SaaS platform designed to provide innovative learning solutions. The platform combines modern web technologies with AI capabilities to deliver an engaging learning experience.

## Current Implementation (as of 2025-01-09)

### 1. Text-to-Speech Feature
- Implemented a modern text-to-speech conversion service
- Frontend: React component with real-time conversion
- Backend: FastAPI endpoint using Google's TTS service
- Seamless audio playback in the browser
- Deployed frontend to Vercel

### Technical Stack

#### Frontend
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- React 18 for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript
- Component-based architecture
- Vercel for deployment

#### Backend
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for audio conversion
- Python 3.9+
- RESTful API design
- CORS configuration for security

#### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- npm for frontend package management
- pip for Python dependencies
- Development servers on ports 3000/3001 (frontend) and 8000 (backend)
- Vercel CLI for deployment management
